I tried deploying on the Claw Cloud website, but it didnt work. I searched through many platforms, and Railway was the only one that worked.

 ## Docker Challenges and Solution

During the development of this project, I encountered an issue where Docker was not starting correctly on my system. After investigating the problem, I found that the cause was an outdated version of **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, which Docker relies on to run on Windows.

To resolve this issue, I updated WSL to the latest version using the official update command. After the update, Docker started working properly without any further issues. Although working with Docker (and Docker Compose concepts) was challenging at firstespecially understanding how containers and services interactit was an interesting learning experience that added significant value to the assignment.

Overall, using Docker made the project more professional and enjoyable.

## Git and GitHub Lessons Learned

One of the most important lessons learned from this assignment was the effective use of **Git and GitHub** for version control. I learned how to commit changes incrementally, push updates to a remote repository, and maintain a clean project history.

This workflow helped me track my progress, organize my work, and avoid common mistakes such as losing changes. Using GitHub also made the project easier to manage and ready for collaboration.
